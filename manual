This project has a single index.html file where all the transfoprmations to the 3D object will be displayed.

There's a menu in the top right hand corner of the main screen that will guide on what to change and how to change it.

The Position, rotation and shear transformations are implemented and are functioning properly. 

The project only supports two light modes at this point in time. Spot light and Directional light.

The 3D object can also be scaled and translated directly using the scale option in the aforementioned menu. 

Of the projections we learned, there's only support to change the isometric, dimetric, trimetric 
projections.

You can also toggle between to one, two and three point projections.
